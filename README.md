## Core Features 🎯
This application is split into two primary user-facing sections, each with a rich set of features.

### 👨‍💻 The Interviewee Experience
The candidate journey is designed to be as smooth and intuitive as possible.

- **Resume Upload:** The user is greeted by a clean, professional landing page with animated background icons. They can upload their resume in either PDF or DOCX format. The application uses pdf.js and mammoth.js to parse these files locally.

- **AI-Powered Data Parsing:** The extracted text from the resume is sent to the Google Gemini API, which intelligently identifies and extracts the candidate's Name, Email, and Phone Number.

- **Interactive Information Gathering:** If the AI cannot find any of the three key details, the application initiates a chat-based flow. The chatbot will sequentially ask for the missing information until the candidate's profile is complete. This entire state is managed by Redux.

- **Automated Technical Interview:**
  - Once the profile is complete, the AI generates 6 unique technical questions tailored for a "Full Stack (React/Node.js)" role. To ensure quality and variety, the request specifies 2 Easy, 2 Medium, and 2 Hard questions.
  - The interview proceeds one question at a time, with each question presented as a multiple-choice query.
  - A dedicated timer (Easy: 20s, Medium: 60s, Hard: 120s) adds a sense of urgency and realism. The system automatically submits the answer and moves on if the time expires.

- **Session Persistence & Recovery:** Leveraging redux-persist, the entire interview state is saved in localStorage. If the user closes the tab, a "Welcome Back" modal prompts them to either resume the session or start over, preventing any loss of progress.

- **Final Results:** Upon completing the final question, the application calculates the score and sends the full interview transcript to the Gemini API for a final, qualitative summary of the candidate's performance.

### 🕵️‍♀️ The Interviewer Dashboard
The interviewer dashboard provides a centralized and efficient way to review and compare candidates.

- **Centralized Candidate List:** The dashboard presents a clean, sortable table of all candidates who have completed the interview.

- **Rich Data Display:** For each candidate, the table displays their Name, Email, Phone, Final Score, and the concise AI Summary. The score is color-coded (success, warning, error) for at-a-glance performance analysis.

- **Powerful Search & Sort:** Interviewers can instantly filter the list by searching for a candidate's name or sort the entire table by Name (alphabetically) or Final Score (descending/ascending).

- **Detailed Candidate Drill-Down:** Clicking "View" on any candidate navigates to a detailed report page, which includes:
  - The candidate's full profile information.
  - The final score and detailed AI summary.
  - A complete, message-by-message chat transcript of their entire interview, allowing for a full audit of their answers and performance.

### Architectural Decisions 🏛️
- **React with Vite:** Chosen for its fast development server, optimized builds, and modern JavaScript features.

- **Redux Toolkit with Redux Persist:** This combination provides a powerful, centralized state management solution. It simplifies state logic and, crucially, handles the persistence requirement of the assignment, ensuring a seamless user experience across sessions.

- **Material-UI (MUI):** Selected for its comprehensive set of pre-built, production-ready components. This allows for rapid development of a clean, professional, and responsive UI that is also easily themeable (as seen with the dark/light mode toggle).

- **Dedicated Service Layer:** All external API calls are isolated in `src/services/aiService.js`. This separation of concerns makes the code cleaner, easier to maintain, and allows the UI components to remain unaware of the specific implementation details of the AI integration.

## AI Integration Deep Dive 🧠
The core AI logic is encapsulated in `src/services/aiService.js`. To ensure stability and handle the constraints of the free-tier API, several key strategies were implemented:
- **Structured Prompts:** All communication with the Gemini API is done via meticulously crafted prompts that instruct the model to return its response in a strict JSON format. This makes the data reliable and easy to parse.
- **Sequential API Calls:** To avoid hitting the API's rate limits (e.g., requests per minute), the calls to generate Easy, Medium, and Hard questions are made sequentially with a built-in delay, rather than in parallel.
- **Response Validation:** After receiving data from the AI, the application performs a validation step to ensure that each question object contains all the necessary fields (like text and options) before it's added to the interview. This makes the application resilient to occasional inconsistencies from the AI model.
